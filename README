  bin/       - Assembled and compiled js files go here.

Compiling bin/jquery.gl.min.js:
  $ cd ./tools
  $ python compile.py

Notes:
  The uncompiled library requires the sylvester js matrix library. The compiled
  version does not.
  We use Google closure compiler (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to
  compile the library.
